## For FTs:

- List baskets of tokens for exchange in the marketplace for ADA (Example INDY, LQ, Meld, Lenfi for ADA). The ADA equivalent will be based on the live trading prices of the commulative tokens in the bundle tracked from Minswap or any other dex. This allows you to trade a collection of tokens without slippage and paying a one time fee instead of buying individually on a DEX and also help in seamless trading of tokens with low liquidity (Unrealized profits solved through this).

- Exchange X asset for Y asset.

## For NFTs:

- Filter of NFTs will be based on traits and or rarity.

- NFT for NFT swaps (By traits and or rarity).

- Purchase NFTs with any agreed Currency by the seller i.e NFT to FT swap (The sale contract will come with the accepted currency by the seller). Imagine selling a clay and accepting payment in OSM or SNEK or any other token aside from ADA.
